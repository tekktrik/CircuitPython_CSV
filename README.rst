CircuitPython helper library for working with CSV files


Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `MicroPython's regular expression library (re) <https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/library/re.html>`_

You can find which Adafruit boards have the re library `here <https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shared-bindings/support_matrix.html>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_
or individual libraries can be installed using
`circup <https://github.com/adafruit/circup>`_.

Installing to a Connected CircuitPython Device with Circup
==========================================================

Make sure that you have ``circup`` installed in your Python environment.
Install it with the following command if necessary:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install circup

With ``circup`` installed and your CircuitPython device connected use the
following command to install:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup install csv

Or the following command to update an existing version:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup update

Installing from PyPI
====================

.. note::

    This library is provided on PyPI so that code developed for microcontrollers with this
    library will also run on computers like the Raspberry Pi.  If you just need a package
    for working with CSV files on a computer only, consider using the Python standard
    library's ``csv`` module instead.

On supported GNU/Linux systems like the Raspberry Pi, you can install the driver locally `from
PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/circuitpython-csv/>`_. To install for current user:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install circuitpython-csv

To install system-wide (this may be required in some cases):

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo pip3 install circuitpython-csv

To install in a virtual environment in your current project:

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir project-name && cd project-name
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install circuitpython-csv

Usage Example
=============

.. code-block:: python

    import board
    import sdcardio
    import storage
    import circuitpython_csv as csv

    # Initialize SD card
    spi = board.SPI()
    sdcard = sdcardio.SDCard(spi, board.D10)
    vfs = storage.VfsFat(sdcard)
    storage.mount(vfs, "/sd")

    # Write the CSV file!
    with open("/sd/testwrite.csv", mode="w", encoding="utf-8") as writablefile:
        csvwriter = csv.writer(writablefile)
        csvwriter.writerow(["I", "love", "CircuitPython", "!"])
        csvwriter.writerow(["Spam"] * 3)
